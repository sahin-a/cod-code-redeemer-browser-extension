This is a super duper basic and ultra slapped together browser extension. The only purpose it served was to activate my friends collection of monster energy double xp codes 😂😂 So yes, no actual brainwork has flood into this. Bunch of parts of it, is badly generated with gemini. No I haven't developed any browser extension before and yes it loses it's state when closing the popup. cba to fix it since I don't really need this any longer, plus it's fast af anyways so why put extra work into this garbage.
